## Available Scripts

For time saving I've used create-react-app with its default configuration.

Install dependencies to start:
#### `npm install`
 
You can run default create-react-app scripts and few custom:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`
Runs tests. There are only test's examples

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

#### `npm run lint`
Runs eslint code checking

#### `npm run flow`
Manually runs flow-typed code checking
